				<div class="textAboutMe"><br><p>I am Khayal Abbas Akhtar , Currently working as Visiting Faculty at Iqra University , Islamabad .I am a Machine Learning enthusiastic researcher with background in Software Engineerng and passion for Computer Science.		
				<br><br><p>I became interested in Machine Learning in 2018, as I discovered that many abstract mathematical objects that I learned during college have very interesting applications to real-world problems.
				<br><br><p>I have been involved with different area related development projects at various level as well as having education with the focus of Artificial Intelligence & Higher Programming Languages in multicultural international environment from a European University. I always been fascinated by the R&D side of computer science and software. 
				<br><br><p>In 2018 , Government of Slovakia awarded me with scholarship to study at University of Zilina, Slovakia among the 19 people from all over the world. I have development experience in Artificial Intelligence and Software development from RISE research Center NUST, and Internet of Things(IoT) as well as embedded system from my final year dissertation .
